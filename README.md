Hey, this project is a simple task manager.
By opening the .exe file it will allow you to edit the tasks.json file (if you don't already have one, it will be created)
You can also check progress of tasks.
Commands:
add "task"
update [id] "task"
remove [id]
list
    list done
    list todo
    list in-progress
mark-in-progress [id]
mark-done [id]
